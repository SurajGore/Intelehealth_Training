        var lg = new Mobile();
        //this will show undefined becoz a is neither defined in the function nor in the function's prototype
        //it first checks if lg object have property a as it doesn't have it so it go to its prototype object pointed by _proto_ and ask him if he has property a as it also doesn't have it so finally we receive undefined. This is how it works behind the browser and JS Engine is the responsible for this task
