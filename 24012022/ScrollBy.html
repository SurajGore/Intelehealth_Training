        Chrome OS (sometimes styled as chromeOS) is a Gentoo Linux-based 


        operating system designed by Google. It is derived from the free software Chromium OS and uses the Google Chrome web browser as its principal user interface. Unlike Chromium OS, Chrome OS is proprietary software.

        Google announced the project, based on Ubuntu,[8] in July 2009, conceiving
        
        it as an operating system in which both applications and user data reside in the cloud: 
        
        hence Chrome OS primarily runs web applications.[9] 
        
        Source code and a public demo came that November. The first Chrome OS laptop, 
        
        known as a Chromebook, arrived in May 2011. Initial Chromebook shipments from 
        
        Samsung and Acer occurred in July 2011.

Chrome OS has an integrated media player and file manager. It supports Progressive W

eb Apps and Chrome Apps; these resemble native applications, as well as remote access 

to the desktop. As more Chrome OS machines have entered the market, the operating syste

m is now seldom evaluated apart from the hardware that runs it.[10]


Android applications started to become available for the operating system in 2014, a

nd in 2016, access to Android apps in Google Play's entirety was introduced on support

ed Chrome OS devices. Support for a Linux terminal and applications, known as Projec

t Crostini,[11] was released to the stable channel in 2018 with Chrome OS 69. This was 

made possible via a lightweight Linux kernel that runs containers inside a virtual machine.

Chrome OS is only available pre-installed on hardware from Google manufacturing partners, b

ut there are unofficial methods that allow it to be installed on other equipment.[12] Its

open-source upstream, Chromium OS, can be compiled from downloaded source code. Early on, 

Google provided design goals for Chrome OS, but has not otherwise released a technical description.
    
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi; 2 October 1869  30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer,[4] 

anti-colonial nationalist[5] and political ethicist[6] who employed nonviolent resistan

ce to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule,[7] and to

later inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mah

ātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Afric

a, is now used throughout the world.[8][9]

Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inn

er Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.

Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule.[10] Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.

Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British India.[11] In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire[11] was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan.[12] As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several hunger strikes to stop the religious violence. The last of these, begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948 when he was 78,[13] also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan.[13] Although the Government of India relented, as did the religious rioters, the belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defence of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims, especially those besieged in Delhi, spread among some Hindus in India.[14][13] Among these was Nathuram Godse, a militant Hindu nationalist from western India, who assassinated Gandhi by firing three bullets into the chest at an inter-faith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948.[15]

Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is commonly, though not formally, considered the Father of the Nation in India[16][17] and was commonly called Bapu[
